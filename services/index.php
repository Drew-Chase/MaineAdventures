			<h3>Hunting</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<p>The North Maine Woods is noted for its big bucks! We are located in the heart of buck country. Our area offers hundreds of miles of maintained roads, making it a hunter's paradise for deer, bear, grouse, rabbit, moose, coyotes, and birdwatching. Allagash Gateway Campground & Cabins has it all. Keep an eye out for changes regarding bear baiting and guiding. Our area is also home to an incredible number of moose. If you are lucky enough to be selected in the annual moose lottery, please note that moose hunting season requires a permit.</p>
